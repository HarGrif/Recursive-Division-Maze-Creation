# Recursive Division Maze Generation
This Python code implements Recursive Division to generate mazes.

Here are some mazes it created at different resolutions:

![Image of Maze 50](50.png)
Resolution = 50

![Image of Maze 25](25.png)
Resolution = 25

![Image of Maze 5](5.png)
Resolution = 5

It was created as a sub-project of my Final Year Project on Genetic Algorithms at University to generate training maps for the GA.

## Features
- Creates randomly generated mazes
- Garunteed path between any two points
- Variable maze resolution
- Randomly generated goals and start points

## Usage

The function simply takes two parameters, map size and map resolution. Map size is allocated when creating a the class and the resolution is then given when you populate the map.

See the example script [here](link) for more info.
